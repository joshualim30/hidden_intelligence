## Introduction

Hidden Intelligence is a mobile game and web app designed to test your trust in your friends. The game is simple: you and your friends are given a prompt, and so is an AI chatbot. You must decide which prompt is the AI's, and which is your friend's. The game is designed to test your trust in your friends, and to see how well you know them.

## Installation

To install Hidden Intelligence, simply download the app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-intelligence/id6736437352) or the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joshualim.hiddeniq). You can also play the game on the web by visiting [hiddeniqgame.com](https://hiddeniqgame.com) online.

## Rules

Hidden Intelligence is a simple game with a few rules. The game is designed to be played with 3+ players, (more players, more fun!), and can be played in person or remotely. A user can either create a game and share the room code, or join a game via code or the game discovery page to find other ongoing games in the same region. The game is played in rounds, and each round consists of the following steps:

### Playing the Game

1. The game creator will start the game and select the number of rounds to play.

2. At the start of each round, a random prompt is selected by the game server depending on the selected pack.

3. Users will then answer the prompt in their own words.

4. The game server will then generate a prompt on the host's device using [Google's Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) API. The AI will take in the prompt, and users responses to assist it in generating a human-like response.

5. The game server will then display the AI's response and a random user's response to the other users. The users must then decide which response is the AI's and which is the user's.

6. Users who guess the AI's response correctly will earn points depending on the difficulty of the current game (Easy: +3, Medium: +4, Hard: +5). Every user who fails to guess the AI's response correctly will award the AI points (Easy: +1, Medium: +2, Hard: +3).

7. The game will continue until the selected number of rounds is reached, displaying the results at the end of each round and revealing who said each response.

### Winning the Game

The game will end after the selected number of rounds is reached. The user with the most points at the end of the game will be declared the winner. In the event of a tie, the user who guessed the AI's response correctly the most times will be declared the winner. If there is still a tie, the user who guessed the AI's response correctly the fastest will be declared the winner! Winners will receive "Brains" as a reward, and all users will receive "Intelligence Points" or "IQ Points" based off the points they earned during the game. IQ Points can be used to unlock new packs, skins, and more in the game!
