Hidden Intelligence Planning

What is Hidden Intelligence:
Hidden Intelligence is a mobile game on Android and iOS I am creating. It is a family and group-setting game where users and a chatbot compete against each other when given prompts. Prompts are theoretical and designed to test your humanity, such as "What three things would you have if you were stranded on an island alone?" The game works by the users answering first, then depending on the difficulty, the AI reads the prompt and all user answers and generates their most human-like response to try to blend in. The round ends when each user votes, and users who guess what response was generated by the AI is rewarded points, where as the AI gets points when they trick a user. Brains are awarded to any users that beat the AI at the end of all rounds and are top of the leaderboard, and IQ (Intelligence Points) are rewards for each correct guess, round played, and watching ads. The add is Freemium with ads, and promotes users to buy IQ points from the shop to purchase prompt packs and more. The current in app purchases are:

- Remove Ads ($2.99)
- Small Study Pack ($0.99) (100 IQ Points)
- Medium Study Pack ($4.99) (600 IQ Points)
- Large Study Pack ($9.99) (1250 IQ Points)

Currently I am considering making each round played +1 points, each correct IQ guess is either +3, +4, or +5 depending on difficulty set (Easy, Medium, Hard), and the AI gets +2 points for each player fooled. 

ChatGPT Suggestions:

1. Pricing and IQ Points
Your current pricing for in-app purchases is pretty reasonable for a freemium game:

Remove Ads ($2.99): Standard price point, aligns well with successful games that offer this option. No adjustments needed here.

Small Study Pack ($0.99 for 100 IQ Points): This is fine for a microtransaction. It entices casual players to make impulse purchases.

Medium Study Pack ($4.99 for 600 IQ Points): Also fair, though a 5x increase in price for a 6x increase in points is generous.

Large Study Pack ($9.99 for 1250 IQ Points): This feels slightly imbalanced, offering only a bit more than double the Medium pack. Many successful games tend to provide a larger perceived "value boost" in higher-tier packs (e.g., 3x-5x value increase). Consider making it something like 1500-1800 points to make the top tier more enticing.

Suggestion:
Increase the Large Study Pack to offer 1500-1800 IQ Points to make it feel like a great value for money. This could drive higher-value transactions and make players more likely to invest at the top tier.

2. Earning Points In-Game
You mentioned:

+1 IQ per round played
+3 to +5 IQ for correct guesses (depending on difficulty)
AI gets +2 points for fooling a player
These numbers work for a casual pace, but frequent free point accumulation could slow down purchases. Let's compare this to other models:

Games that rely heavily on in-app purchases often limit "free" points to encourage users to buy packs. Offering too many IQ Points for correct guesses might allow players to rack up points without much incentive to purchase. Players need to feel like purchasing is a shortcut or advantage.
Adjustments:

For rounds played, you could consider scaling back to +0.5 to +1 IQ per round. This slows down free accumulation and pushes players to consider buying more packs to unlock premium content.

For correct guesses, you can keep the +3 to +5 IQ system, but make the difficulty progression steeper. For example, +3 for easy, +4 for medium, +6 for hard (instead of +5). You could also limit correct guesses bonuses to only a set number of rounds per session—incentivizing continuous play or making users wait or buy IQ Points to continue.

3. Points for Watching Ads
Allowing users to watch ads for IQ Points is a common practice but must be balanced to prevent players from spamming ads and avoiding purchases. For games like Hidden Intelligence, you might offer 5-10 IQ Points per ad watched, but place a limit of 3-5 ads per day.

This way, users can still engage for free, but there’s a cap that keeps the economy balanced. Another option is to allow players to watch an ad for a temporary power-up or multiplier (e.g., double IQ Points for one round), which makes ads more engaging.

4. Power-Ups and Challenges
Adding power-ups and daily challenges can both drive engagement and monetize well. Let’s explore some ideas:

Power-Ups:
IQ Boost: Temporarily doubles the IQ Points earned for correct guesses or rounds played for a limited time (e.g., next 5 rounds). This could be purchased for 50-100 IQ Points or rewarded for watching ads.

AI Blur: Makes the AI’s answer appear less suspicious, increasing difficulty. This could cost 75-150 IQ Points and give the AI a chance to gain more points (players might want to buy this to make games more challenging for themselves or others).

Second Guess: Allows a user to guess a second time in a round, reducing the AI’s chances of fooling them. Could be priced at 25-50 IQ Points.

These power-ups offer low-cost purchases that incentivize IQ spending and help drive the in-game economy.

Challenges & Events:
Daily/Weekly Challenges: Offer bonus IQ Points for completing tasks such as “Play 5 rounds,” “Win 3 rounds on Hard,” or “Trick 2 players as the AI.” Rewards could range from 10-50 IQ Points per challenge, depending on difficulty.

Leaderboard Rewards: At the end of the week, reward the top players on the leaderboard with 100-500 IQ Points or exclusive content. This encourages competition and may drive purchases for players trying to climb the ranks.

Limited-Time Events: Introduce special themed prompt packs or seasonal content (e.g., Halloween prompts). Players can buy exclusive packs or unlock limited-time rewards with IQ Points, driving urgency.

5. Adjusting Pack Prices
In terms of how many points prompt packs should cost, this depends on the value of those prompts in your game’s ecosystem. If you want players to feel like they're getting meaningful content:

Small Prompt Pack (10 prompts): 50 IQ Points
Medium Prompt Pack (30 prompts): 120-150 IQ Points
Large Prompt Pack (50 prompts): 200-250 IQ Points
This pricing ensures players can unlock a few new packs with their earned points, but might still be motivated to purchase IQ Points for access to more premium content quickly.

6. Long-Term Monetization and Player Retention
A key balance to hit is ensuring users are engaged enough to play regularly without feeling that free points make purchases irrelevant. If players can grind to unlock all premium content, they won’t be incentivized to buy. Therefore:

Introduce time-based mechanics: E.g., allow players to earn points at a steady but slower pace and offer time-based events or power-ups for extra IQ Points (perhaps available only for purchase or via ads).

Frequent updates with new prompt packs, special events, and seasonal content help keep players engaged long-term. Making certain prompt packs exclusive and then vaulting them can create FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and motivate purchases.

Conclusion
To summarize the key improvements:

Rebalance IQ Point earnings: Slightly reduce free point accumulation to encourage spending. Add caps or conditions to bonuses from correct guesses and ads.
Boost pack value: Increase the IQ Points in your Large Study Pack to make it more enticing.
Limit ad rewards: Allow 5-10 points per ad watched with a daily cap to prevent abuse.
Add power-ups and challenges: Integrate engaging mechanics that reward players while driving monetization.
Tweak prompt pack prices: Make prompt packs cost a reasonable but compelling number of IQ Points to incentivize both grinding and purchases.
This strategic approach should help balance your in-game economy, drive engagement, and ultimately maximize your monetization potential while keeping players invested in Hidden Intelligence.

To keep players engaged and add variety, offering additional game modes that add unique twists to the core gameplay is a great idea. Below are some game mode suggestions, each designed to add a layer of depth, challenge, or social interaction to the existing structure of Hidden Intelligence:

1. Speed Round Mode
Twist: Players have limited time (e.g., 15-30 seconds) to answer prompts and vote on AI-generated responses. The AI also generates answers faster based on a smaller subset of available user responses.

Challenge: The time pressure forces players to make quicker decisions, which could lead to more mistakes and wrong guesses.

Scoring: Points are awarded based on both accuracy and speed. Correctly identifying the AI within a short time window earns bonus IQ Points, while failing to respond in time results in a penalty.

Why it works: This mode is perfect for players who enjoy quick, intense rounds, and it adds a new layer of excitement as players balance speed and precision.

2. Co-op vs. AI Mode
Twist: In this mode, all human players work together to try to beat a more sophisticated AI that has access to extra information, such as a deeper analysis of each player’s personality or playstyle (based on past answers).

Challenge: The AI is intentionally more difficult to spot, with responses crafted to target the group’s weak points. Players collaborate to discuss which answer is likely AI-generated, but each individual still votes.

Scoring: If the majority of players correctly guess the AI’s response, they all earn extra points. If the AI manages to trick the majority, it gains a large point bonus.

Why it works: It fosters collaboration and builds team dynamics. This also provides a fresh change from competitive gameplay, making it feel more strategic and social.

3. Elimination Mode
Twist: In this mode, players are gradually eliminated when they fail to guess the AI correctly. The last player standing wins a large point bonus, while the AI tries to eliminate as many players as possible.

Challenge: The AI gets more dangerous as the game progresses because there are fewer responses to blend in with. Players who survive longer earn higher IQ Points, but each wrong guess could knock them out.

Scoring: Players earn increasingly larger bonuses for surviving multiple rounds. The AI earns points for each player it eliminates.

Why it works: This mode brings a high-stakes, knockout element that raises the intensity and adds emotional investment, as players fight to stay in the game as long as possible.

4. Blind Round Mode
Twist: After answering the prompt, players vote without seeing their own answers in the list of possible responses. They won’t know which one is theirs until after voting.

Challenge: It forces players to focus purely on the content of the responses without the bias of knowing what they wrote. This adds a mind game, as players might accidentally vote for their own answer thinking it's AI-generated.

Scoring: The AI earns points for each player that votes incorrectly, while players earn points based on accurate guessing despite the additional confusion.

Why it works: This mode tests players' instincts and adds a psychological element where they can second-guess themselves. It leads to surprising results and fun, chaotic rounds.

5. Double Bluff Mode
Twist: In this mode, two AI responses are mixed in with the user-generated responses, but only one is real. Players must decide which one is the actual AI-generated answer and which is a bluff planted to confuse them.

Challenge: The added AI answer makes it harder to pinpoint the real one. Players must evaluate the subtle differences between AI-generated responses, increasing the difficulty.

Scoring: Correctly identifying the real AI answer earns higher points (e.g., +5), but falling for the decoy or bluff results in negative points. The AI earns points for each player tricked by the decoy.

Why it works: This mode introduces higher levels of trickery and analysis, rewarding players who can spot nuanced AI behavior while punishing those who get overconfident.

6. Mimic Mode
Twist: Instead of blending in, the AI mimics one specific player’s tone and style. All answers are anonymized, so players don’t know which one is theirs until after the round.

Challenge: The AI's goal is to perfectly replicate a human's tone, and the humans must figure out which answer isn't actually theirs. Since they won’t know who the AI is copying, everyone becomes a suspect.

Scoring: Players who successfully guess the AI earn points, while the AI earns bonus points for each player it fools into thinking its response is human.

Why it works: This mode adds a psychological edge, forcing players to confront their own tendencies and writing styles. It also adds variety, keeping rounds fresh by focusing on AI mimicry rather than just blending in.

7. Reverse AI Mode
Twist: The human players take turns pretending to be the AI, and the AI picks the prompt answer it thinks is the most “human-like.” Players try to craft answers that the AI will select as the most human.

Challenge: It flips the script entirely, requiring players to think like the AI, while the AI judges responses. Players compete to outsmart the AI, making this a creative, role-reversal challenge.

Scoring: Players get points for being chosen by the AI, while the AI earns points if it correctly identifies multiple human answers. Extra points for players if they fool the AI into picking an answer that is deliberately nonsensical but human-seeming.

Why it works: This mode allows players to engage with the AI mechanics from a new perspective. By role-playing as the AI, players get to explore how AI decision-making works, making the game even more dynamic.

8. Memory Round Mode
Twist: Before voting, players are shown all the answers for a limited time, and then the answers disappear. Players must rely on their memory to identify the AI’s response.

Challenge: This mode tests both memory and deduction skills. Players who struggle to recall details may end up guessing wrong, adding another dimension of difficulty.

Scoring: If a player votes correctly based on memory alone, they get bonus points. If they forget and vote incorrectly, they lose points. The AI gains points when players misremember responses.

Why it works: It adds a memory component, which can make rounds more unpredictable and give an advantage to players with sharp recall skills. It introduces an element of cognitive challenge beyond typical deduction.

Final Thoughts:
Each of these game modes adds variety to the traditional gameplay loop of Hidden Intelligence while keeping the core mechanics intact. They help prevent the game from becoming repetitive and encourage players to return for different types of experiences. Additionally, these modes can be selectively unlocked through IQ points or featured in seasonal events to keep players engaged and increase monetization potential.
